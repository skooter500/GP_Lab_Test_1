# Game Programming Lab Test 1 2016

Rules of the test:
- Create a new, empty Processing sketch
- Remember to save your work often!
- Put a comment at the top of your sketch with your name and student number
- Put comments in your code to explain what is happening
- Submit your sketch to webcourses when you are finished

Here is a video of the sketch you need to make today:

What is happening:

- The red person is controlled by the left and right arrow keys and can't move beyond the bounds of the screen.
- The box drops from the top of the screen and falls to the bottom of the screen at a random speed of between 1 amd 5. It starts at a random x and has a random colour.
- If the player "catches" the box, the Collected count increases by one.
- If the box reaches the bottom of the screen, without being caught, the Missed count increases by 1.
- Every time the box is colleceted or reaches the bottom of the screen, it respawns at the top of the screen again at a random x position, with a new random speed and colour.

| Drawing and implementing the falling box | 25 |
| Checking for collisions and implementing Collected and Missed counts | 25 |
| Code style, commenting & solution elegance | 25 |
